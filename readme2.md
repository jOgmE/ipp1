##     Test script (test.php)
Script for test automation. The script can be used in three different modes: parser only, interpret only and both.

####    Implementation
The script is written using functional paradigm.

The first section consists of command line arguments parsing and checking their appropriateness saving the outcome to global variables. 

The second section constist of shorter functions what are implemented separately from and used by the main function `test`. These functions are: `run_par`, `run_inter` which are running the parser or the interpret using command line execution, then returning the output and the error code of the program, `check_difference` and `check_xml_difference` which are checking the difference between the given output files and the generated temporary files. `Diff` command is used to check the correctness of the return code of the tested program and the output of the  interpret and the command `jexamxml` is used for checking the correctness of the output generated by the parser.

The third section is the `test` function what runs all the tests in the given directory. The function uses recursiveness to traverse all the subdirectories, but ignoring dot directories. The main flow of the function is to go through the given directory. If an another directory is found, then calling itself recursively or it performs tests if a file with the `.src` ending is found. Every other file is ignored. After the test is run the return code is checked (which was saved to temporary file). The generated output (which was saved to temporary file too) is checked on success, but not on failure. Then global counters are raised based on the success or failure of the checks described above. The temporary files are deleted and a html table is generated and saved to a variable. The returned html table is included into the hardcoded html page defined in the fourth part.

## Interpret
#### Implementation
The interpret is written in object orientated paradigm. Except few support classes, the classes represents the part of the interpret. The support classes are for parsing the program arguments, error classes, a stack, working with input files and a class for checking the correction of the input data and holding all of the labels with their order number. The parts of the interpret includes memory, instructions and the interpret.

##### Memory
The `Mem` class holds the frames (local, temporary (which needs to be defined), global, data stack and an instruction stack) and implements the functions for working with the frames.
##### Instructions
Sets are created to determine what instructions take what and how many operands e.g. instruction `jumpifeq` takes 3 operands: a label and two symbols. The class holds a dictionary which has saved all the instructions name and a corresponding function declared inside this class implementing it.
#### Interpret
The interpret is the main class of the program. The main idea is to iterate through the instructions already readed in the class Files, get the operands of the current instruction and perform the instruction. There was a problem, the operands of the instruction can be in any order. The solution being used here was creating three boolean variables representing the highest possible number of operands. After all the operands were parsed, the program checks for the correctness of these operands using the booleans. Python does not support switch-case control flow, so the program uses a one-line solution to call the correct function describing the instruction, using the dictionary defined in the class Instructions.
#### Instruction iterator
Instruction iterator is a nested class inside Files. It's purpose is to create an iterator through the instructions, but with a support of jumping - changing the flow of the iteration.
