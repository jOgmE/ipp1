##     Test script (test.php)
Script for test automation. The script can be used in three different modes: parser only, interpret only and both.

####    Implementation
The script is written using functional paradigm.
The first section consists of command line arguments parsing and checking their appropriateness saving the outcome to global variables. Shorter functions are implemented separated from and used by the main function `test`. These functions are: `run_par`, `run_inter` which are running the parser or the interpret using command line execution, then returning the output and the error code of the program, `check_difference` and `check_xml_difference` which are for checking the difference between the given output files and the generated temporary files. `Diff` command is used to check the correctness of the return code of the tested program and the command `jexamxml` is used for checking the correctness of the output generated by the parser.
